Voicero AI is a smart AI chat plugin that turns visitors into customers by answering questions and guiding them to buy.


== Description ==
Every unanswered question is a sale slipping through your fingers. Support tickets cost time and payroll, while shoppers wait for help. Voicero AI drops a voice- and text-ready chatbot into your WordPress store so customers get instant answers, staff reclaim their day, and revenue keeps climbing even when you're off-line.

== TOP FEATURES — BUILT FOR GROWTH ==
• Conversational AI (voice + chat) — Natural, on-brand conversation instantly
• One-click install — Activate and start deflecting tickets in under five minutes
• Knowledge-base sync — Auto-pulls data from pages, FAQs, docs, and blogs
• Smart escalations — Hands high-value or sensitive issues to your help-desk tool
• Checkout booster — Prompts discounts, upsells, and back-in-stock inside chat
• Real-time analytics — See tickets deflected, tickets received, commonly asked questions

== GETTING STARTED ==
1. Install & activate Voicero AI in WordPress
2. Connect your store with a secure API token
3. Import content (pages, FAQs, docs, CSV) automatically
4. Launch the branded widget and watch the inbox quiet down

== Pricing ==
**Starter:** $120 per month

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Voicero AI? =
A chatbot that displays on the front of your website, to answer any single question a user has about your specific company/product.

= How does it talk back? =
Don't be alarmed, we use a combination of the best in class voice-ai tools to make the conversation as efficient as possible.

= How is this different from every other chatbot? =
Voicero AI is a dimensional agent, designed to be custom to your store. Meaning any question a user has, the AI will find the appropriate answer and curate the most appropriate response to ensure your customers satisfaction. Voicero can handle returns, cancellations, schedule management, and product recommendations all within the chatbot itself.

= What happens if the AI is stumped? =
We don't believe in dead ends. If a question is asked the AI doesn't know, the user will be prompted to submit a short message that will go to your store, which can be found on the Voicero AI dashboard that you will gain access to.

= Is this safe? =
Safety was our number one priority when building Voicero AI. Even with all the complex features, store data is stored safely, out of our possession meaning we have no access to it. Customer safety is ensured through many data collection policies we have put in place.

= Do I need a Voicero.AI account? =
Yes. You must sign up at voicero.ai to receive your access key and manage your AI assistant. The account starts free and will auto connect you with one button click.

= Will this affect my site's performance? =
No. Voicero.AI is fully asynchronous and optimized to avoid blocking your frontend or admin experience.

= Does this work with WooCommerce? =
Yes. Voicero.AI supports syncing and training on your products, including reviews, categories, and tags.
