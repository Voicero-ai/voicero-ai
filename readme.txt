Voicero AI is a smart AI chat plugin that turns visitors into customers by answering questions and guiding them to buy.

== Description ==
Every unanswered question is a sale slipping through your fingers. Support tickets cost time and payroll, while shoppers wait for help. Voicero AI drops a voice- and text-ready chatbot into your WordPress store so customers get instant answers, staff reclaim their day, and revenue keeps climbing even when you’re off-line.

== TOP FEATURES — BUILT FOR GROWTH ==
• Conversational AI (voice + chat) — Natural, on-brand conversation instantly  
• One-click install — Activate and start deflecting tickets in under five minutes  
• Knowledge-base sync — Auto-pulls data from pages, FAQs, docs, and blogs  
• Smart escalations — Hands high-value or sensitive issues to your help-desk tool  
• Checkout booster — Prompts discounts, upsells, and back-in-stock inside chat  
• Real-time analytics — See tickets deflected, tickets received, commonly asked questions

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What is Voicero AI? =
A chatbot that displays on the front of your website to answer any single question a user has about your specific company/product.

= How does it talk back? =
Don’t be alarmed, we use a combination of best-in-class voice-AI tools to make the conversation as efficient as possible.

= How is this different from every other chatbot? =
Voicero AI is a dimensional agent, custom to your store. It finds the appropriate answer and curates the best response—handling returns, cancellations, schedule management, and product recommendations all within the chat.

= What happens if the AI is stumped? =
We don’t believe in dead ends. If the AI can’t answer, the user is prompted to submit a short message that lands in your Voicero AI dashboard.

= Is this safe? =
Safety was our top priority. Store data is stored securely in your possession only—Voicero.ai has no access.

= Do I need a Voicero.AI account? =
Yes. Sign up at voicero.ai to receive your access key and manage your assistant. The account starts free with one-click connection.

= Will this affect my site’s performance? =
No. Voicero AI is fully asynchronous and optimized to avoid blocking your frontend or admin experience.

= Does this work with WooCommerce? =
Yes. Voicero AI supports syncing and training on your products, including reviews, categories, and tags.
